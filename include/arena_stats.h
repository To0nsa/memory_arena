 * @brief
 * Runtime statistics tracking and diagnostics for memory arenas.
 *
 * @details
 * This module defines the `t_arena_stats` structure and a set of utility
 * functions to introspect and manage arena memory usage. It enables users
 * to track allocation metrics, debug issues, and monitor arena behavior over time.
 *
 * Features include:
 * - Allocation and reallocation counters
 * - Peak memory usage tracking
 * - Wasted alignment bytes measurement
 * - Growth history recording for adaptive sizing
 * - Hook-friendly API for visualizers or debuggers
 *
 * Use this module to:
 * - Print real-time diagnostics (`arena_print_stats`)
 * - Fetch current memory usage data (`arena_get_stats`)
 * - Log or reset growth tracking (`arena_stats_record_growth`, `arena_stats_reset`)
 *
 * @note
 * These statistics are gathered automatically by the allocator. Manual updates are rarely needed.

	 * This function outputs a formatted summary of the current arena state to the

	 * debug metadata, and growth history (if available).
	 *
	 * Sections reported:
	 * - Basic layout: buffer address, size, offset, remaining space
	 * - Allocation stats: total allocations, reallocations, failures, alignment waste
	 * - Last allocation metadata: size, offset, ID
	 * - Debug info: ID, label, hook presence, thread safety
	 * - Growth history: sizes recorded during dynamic expansion
	 *
	 * This function is useful for:
	 * - Debugging memory usage patterns
	 * - Verifying arena configuration at runtime
	 * - Profiling custom allocators using arena-backed systems
	 *
	 * @param arena  Pointer to the arena to inspect.
	 * @param stream Output stream to write the diagnostics to (e.g., `stdout`, `stderr`, or a log file).
	 *
	 * @return void
	 *
	 * @ingroup arena_stats

	 * @note
	 * If `arena` or `stream` is `NULL`, the function does nothing.

	 * @brief
	 * Retrieve a snapshot of the current arena statistics.

	 * @details
	 * This function returns a copy of the `t_arena_stats` structure from
	 * the specified arena. The statistics include information such as:
	 * - Number of allocations and reallocations
	 * - Bytes allocated and alignment overhead
	 * - Peak usage and current allocation ID
	 * - Growth history and tracking counters
	 *
	 * This is useful for diagnostics, profiling, logging, or exporting
	 * memory usage metrics to external tools.
	 *
	 * The returned stats are safe to use outside the arena and will not
	 * be affected by future changes to the arena state.
	 *
	 * Thread-safe: acquires the arena lock before reading the data.
	 *
	 * @param arena Pointer to the arena to inspect.
	 *
	 * @return A copy of the arenaâ€™s current statistics. If `arena` is `NULL`,
	 *         returns a zero-initialized `t_arena_stats` structure.

	 * @ingroup arena_stats
	 *
	 * @note
	 * This function performs a shallow copy. The `growth_history` pointer
	 * in the returned struct still points to internal memory managed by the arena.
	 * Do not modify or free it manually.

	 * - Allocation and reallocation counters.
	 * - Total bytes allocated and wasted.
	 * - Peak usage and live allocation tracking.
	 * - Last allocation metadata (size, offset, ID).
	 * - Growth history tracking and counter.

	/**
	 * @brief
	 * Record a new arena growth event in the statistics.
	 *
	 * @details
	 * This function appends a new size value to the `growth_history` array
	 * inside the provided `t_arena_stats` structure. It tracks each time
	 * the arena grows dynamically (via `arena_grow()`), enabling tools and
	 * diagnostics to analyze memory usage trends over time.
	 *
	 * Internally:
	 * - It reallocates the `growth_history` array to make room for the new entry.
	 * - Appends the `new_size` to the end of the list.
	 * - Increments the `growth_history_count`.
	 *
	 * If memory reallocation fails, the function logs a debug message via `ALOG`
	 * (if debug logging is enabled) and exits silently without recording the growth.
	 *
	 * @param stats     Pointer to the `t_arena_stats` structure to update.
	 * @param new_size  The new arena size (in bytes) after a growth operation.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 *
	 * @ingroup arena_stats
	 *
	 * @note
	 * This function is typically called automatically by `arena_grow()`.
	 * The `growth_history` buffer is dynamically managed and grows linearly.
	 *
	 * @warning
	 * This function does nothing if `stats` is `NULL`.
	 * Memory allocation failure is non-fatal but results in data loss for this event.
